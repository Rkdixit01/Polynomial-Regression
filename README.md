# Polynomial Linear Regression
This project demonstrates an implementation of polynomial linear regression, a machine learning technique that models the relationship between independent variables and a dependent variable by fitting a non-linear polynomial curve. In this approach, we transform the input features to capture complex patterns within the data, enabling more accurate predictions for non-linear relationships.

# Project Overview
Polynomial regression is an extension of linear regression that uses polynomial terms to fit a non-linear relationship between features and the target variable. By transforming features to polynomial degrees, the model finds the best-fit curve that minimizes prediction error. This technique is especially useful when the data shows non-linear trends, allowing the model to capture more intricate relationships beyond simple linearity.

# Objective
The goal of this project is to create and train a polynomial regression model that effectively captures non-linear patterns within a dataset. The model leverages polynomial terms to define a curve that best fits the observed data, enabling accurate predictions even with complex data relationships.

# Today's Work
Implemented polynomial regression using Python and relevant libraries.
Transformed the dataset to include polynomial terms for capturing non-linear patterns.
Trained the model, optimizing for minimal prediction error across the transformed features.
Visualized the predicted curve against actual data points to assess model accuracy and its ability to represent non-linear trends.
# Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn
